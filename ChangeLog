- Profiles are encapsulated in PolicyProfile(s) and each PolicyProfile contains
  multiple Profiles (one for the base profile and num_profile ones for the runs
  with changed parameter)
- Each registered policy has an own PolicyProfile in each Tree node
- New search algorithms
  - Search Algorithms are registered to Loop and Policy.
  - The consist of 4 functions (init, next, best, reset) and a name
  - Currently, there is only a basic search trying values from min to max (see loop_adapt_search.c)
  - At each next call, the current value is stored to track the changes and written into file
- Functions of policies currently very similar, maybe use a common one.
- Currently no system state change when changing a parameter. Since policies are
not responsible anymore for changing the paramters but the search algorithms,
the system state needs to be changed by the search algorithm. But the search
algorithm has no knowledge about the actual policy, it just manipulates the
parameters. The solution is that policies provide functions for that and they
are registered in the Nodeparameters's pre and post functions.
