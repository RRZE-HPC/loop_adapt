- Profiles are encapsulated in PolicyProfile(s) and each PolicyProfile contains
  multiple Profiles (one for the base profile and num_profile ones for the runs
  with changed parameter)
- Each registered policy has an own PolicyProfile in each Tree node
- New search algorithms
  - Search Algorithms are registered to Loop and Policy.
  - The consist of 4 functions (init, next, best, reset) and a name
  - Currently, there is only a basic search trying values from min to max (see loop_adapt_search.c)
  - At each next call, the current value is stored to track the changes and written into file
- Functions of policies currently very similar, maybe use a common one.

# 20.08.2018
- Added pre and post parameter change functions. So if the system changes a
parameter, it calls the parameter's pre and post functions (if defined).
The functions are registered in a policies PolicyParameters.
